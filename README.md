CAD-E is a 2D game engine written in [Python] using [PyGame].  It started with the desire to make a simple state based gameplay engine, but almost immediately branched out into a full game engine.  My goal became to touch as many parts of the process as I reasonably could to better understand each piece that goes into an engine, and also some of the challenges other development disciplines face (artists and designers).

The main features in the of the engine are

  - 2D/sprite graphics and animation
  - Music and sound effects
  - XML defined UI and menu system
  - Integrated with [Tiled] map editor
  - State based gameplay programming
  - [Documentation]
  - An example game


To use CAD-E you'll need

  - Python 2.7.x
  - PyGame 1.9.1
  - [Tiled 0.7.2 Java] (optional, for editing levels)
